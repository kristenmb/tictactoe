# ðŸŒ¿ Rainforest Tic Tac Toe ðŸŒ¿

## Description
  This is a two player game of tic tac toe.

## Usage
  Welcome to rainforest tic tac toe. At the top of the page you will see an indication of who's turn it is. The first player can choose any open square on the gameboard in the center of the screen. Once the first player chooses a space, their token will appear and, as depicted at the top of the page, it is now the second player's turn. The goal of the game is to get three of a player's token in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally from one corner of the game board to the other.<br>

  If a player wins, their win count will increase and a new game will begin. Should the game result in a draw, the gameboard will reset automatically to allow another round of game play. Happy playing!
